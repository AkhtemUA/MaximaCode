INTRODUCTION
------------

The figures in this directory will be used in the Maxima manual.
Each figure should be in two versions, PDF and PNG. The PDF version
will be used in the PDF version of the manual, and the PNG version
will be used in the HTML version.

CREATING FIGURES FOR THE MAXIMA MANUAL
--------------------------------------

If the figures are the result of a plot2d or plot3d command, the two
versions needed can be created adding the option pdf_file, and then
png_file, to the plotting command. For example, the two files needed
for a figure named "plot24" might be:

  plot2d (sin(x), [x, -5, 5], [pdf_file, "plot24.pdf"]);
  plot2d (sin(x), [x, -5, 5], [png_file, "plot24.png"]);

ADDING FIGURES TO THE MANUAL
----------------------------

Once the files plot24.pdf and plot24.png have been added in the
doc/info/figures directory, they are added in a section of the manual
using the figure macro:
  @figure{plot24}

Notice that no file-name extension or directory should be given. That
macro should add the figure correctly in any section and in any of the
translations of the manual.

ADDING THE FIGURE TO THE LIST OF FILES TO BE DISTRIBUTED
--------------------------------------------------------

Every time you add a new figure, do not forget to modify the
doc/info/Makefile.am file, adding the name of the two files (PDF and
PNG) to the lists "figurefiles" and "pdffigures". In the example
above,
  figures/plot24.png
should be added to figurefiles and
  figures/plot24.pdf
to pdffigures.
