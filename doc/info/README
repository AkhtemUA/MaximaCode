There currently are no formal rules for adding documentation.

There are some guidelines, though:

 * separate exposition and examples
 * examples recapitulate exposition
 * order exposition by decreasing importance
 * be precise, be complete, get to the point


In order to test if the new document works the following steps
have proven helpful:

- Do the TeXinfo and HTML documentations build without producing new warning
  or error messages? Both will be created after typing the following command:

  make

- Does the pdf documentation build? This type of documentation can be created
  by typing

  make pdf

- Do all of the documentation types look like they should

- Is the documentation accessible to the ? and ?? commands of maxima?
