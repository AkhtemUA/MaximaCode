Improvements / TODOs for the crosscompiling script
==================================================

And some reasons why I did make some decisions...

1. The fixed installation directory (C:\Maxima-VERSION)
-------------------------------------------------------

That was chosen, because of three reasons:

- The default installation root ("C:\Program files") contains a space, which
might cause issues, because one needs to escape it.

- The default installation path for a 32 Bit program is different on 32 and 
64 Bit Windows Systems.

- When one builds Maxima using Autoconf, in './configure', the installation 
prefix (--prefix=...) is set to a fixed value - and that value is used when 
compiling maxima (at least in the manpage (not really relevant on Windows) 
but also for some Lisp-variables (e.g. *autoconf-prefix*, ...).

So making the installation directory not fixed, might cause issues.


Letting the user select his installation directory might be nice, but might
lead to trouble.


2. Using (only) CLISP
---------------------

Clisp was chosen, because it worked nice with "Wine" (which is needed for
crosscompiling) and they just released a ZIP file, which one can easy extract.


Using other LISPs might be a good idea (I tried it), but there are some issues:

SBCL released only a MSI-installer

GCL released exe installers (currently only for older versions)

ECL released an exe installer. 

Trying to crosscompile GCL or ECL did not work for me.

CCL released a ZIP File for windows (which is promising), but sadly it does
not work with wine.


3. No kill/interrupt functionality
----------------------------------

There is a program included (winkill) for interrupting Maxima from wxMaxima
and xMaxima, but that does only work (according to Andrej) for GCL, so that is 
not included in the crosscompiled installer.

Perhaps wxMaxima / Xmaxima can use the (native) Windows command "taskkill" 
instead of  our own winkill) on Windows?


4. Font installation
--------------------

Not really an issue, but currently everything is installed in the directory
C:\maxima-VERSION - except the jsMath TeX-fonts, which are in the Windows 
System Font directory. 
That works, but I uninstall the fonts when one uninstalls Maxima - and the 
user might have used the fonts somewhere else.
It would be nice, if the fonts can also be somewhere in the "C:\Maxima-VERSION" 
installation directory and wxMaxima can read them from there.
