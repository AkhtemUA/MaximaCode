Maxima Internationalization with GNU Gettext
--------------------------------------------

Maxima is prepared to show its messages in any language selected by the
user. The current languages accepted are the ones in the list
TRANSLATIONS at the top of Makefile.am

1. Starting a new language. Copy maxima.pot to LANG.po, where LANG is
the ISO code for the new language. Translate the strings in LANG.po;
we recommend that you start by translating the strings from program
macsys.lisp. Add LANG to the list "TRANSLATIONS" at the top of
Makefile.am. Maxima's configure script should be given the option
--enable-gettext to compile it with Gettext support.

2. Updating a language translation. Run the command:
    msgmerge LANG.po maxima.pot > LANG_new.po
examine LANG_new.po and if it looks correct, replace LANG.po with
it. Translate the new strings.

3. Updating maxima.pot for a new Maxima version. Run the following
commands:
    find ../src -name "*.lisp" -type f -print > files.txt
    find ../share -name "*.lisp" -type f -print >> files.txt
    xgettext -f files.txt
Examine the file messages.po that should have been created and if it
looks correct, replace maxima.pot with it.
